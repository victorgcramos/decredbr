# Decred Brazil - Marketing, Communication and Content Production 2022/2

## What

This proposal seeks funding for pumping up Decred Brazil Marketing and Social
Media visibility in the next 6 months. We intend to act in the following topics
to engage our community:

- Social Media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok), with the creation of
  content and interaction with the community

- Creation of video content for YouTube and Social Media

- Live streaming, chat, and technical support channels with community members on
  Discord https://discord.gg/3WgzztRk. If needed, we can also create a new
  bridged channel on matrix.

- Events and Meetups.

Here are some links for our social media accounts:

- Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/decredbr/)
- Twitter (https://mobile.twitter.com/decred_br)
- Facebook Group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/667062416769204)

## Why

Brazil has a very active, engaged and growing Crypto community. We want to
continue and improve the production of marketing content for the Brazilian
audience. In that way we can engage the community and spread our word to
possible new contributors.

Cryptocurrencies are getting noticed by our local politics too. In the last São
Paulo 2020 Mayor elections, both main candidates Bruno Covas and Guilherme
Boulos used “votolegal”: a platform for transparency in election donations which
runs on [Decred Blockchain](https://blockchain.votolegal.com.br/).

Also on March, 30, Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, [confirmed that Bitcoin
will be incorporated into the city’s treasury](https://exame.com/future-of-money/rio-de-janeiro-confirma-que-vai-incorporar-bitcoin-ao-tesouro-da-cidade/).
This shows how crypto and blockchain are aimed to be part of the future in Brazil.

### Disclaimer

The previous BR marketing proposal hasn't delivered what the stakeholders expected, and we all know Decred community members are really expecting
results, and this is why I am putting myself as a supervisor for this proposal.
I don't have a clear idea about why the previous proposal hasn't delivered what
it expected to deliver. In fact, noticing a lack of community contributions,
I contacted Decred BR old admins to try a new social media communication
approach in November 2021, and
took control of Instagram and Twitter accounts, as well as admin rights on
Facebook group.

I contacted @jpsantanna to help me on that and focus on publishing content almost every day on Instagram and Twitter.

Our first goal was to reactivate the Brazilian community by actively posting
news, project updates and engagement content in a way that the community could
notice our return.

After stablishing a good frequency for content production, we decided to expand
the presence of the BR community on some relevant crypto events. @edsondecre
took the responsibility to actively participate on those events on Apr 2022,
and since then, we were able to participate in some meetups and in some of the
most popular Brazilian Crypto events:

- Bitconf IX (we also promoted a ticket giveaway for BR community members!!
  (https://www.instagram.com/p/CdWkO2JueDU/));
- Cryptominds III (​​https://www.instagram.com/p/CdG9jL5vnu4/);

@eric_vieira also joined us on this meantime. He is the admin of the Decred
Brazil Facebook group, and took the responsibility to post and interact with
the community there.

## Who

- @victorguedes, active Decred Contractor on development domain for 3+ years,
  has been reviewing the technical parts of the posts and also contributing with
  ideas for content production.
- @jpsantanna, crypto enthusiast since 2017 and follows Decred progress
  since 2018. Has been managing and creating content for Decred Brazil Instagram
  and Twitter accounts since November 2021. He was recently invited to collaborate on Decred Magazine.
- @edsondecre has worked on several events for Decred, such as Campus Party,
  Bitconf, and other meetups, with a high-quality community management
  experience. Edson was able to include Decred in several exchanges like:

The Decred Brazil team will be composed by 3 levels of contributors, with
@victorguedes as the supervisor. The roles are detailed below:

#### Level 1

Rate: $10/hr

The Level 1 is the first stage of the Decred Brazil contribution journey. People
who proved to be able to actively contribute over the Decred community, and take
some entry-level responsibilities, which are described below. A Level 1
contributor will have to be supervised by a higher-level contributor, in order
to ensure the correct information, design and quality is published.

##### Expected Roles

- Content production for small assets like images, gifs, post templates,
  banners, short videos (Instagram reels and stories, TikTok videos, Youtube
  shorts);
- Text creation: Twitter threads, posts description, small content translation;
- Support at events, helping to organize, engage and publicize the event;
- Collect community feedbacks;
- Administrate social media pages;

#### Level 2

Rate: $20/hr

The Level 2 represents a more experienced stage, where contributors are ready to
produce content on an autonomous way, i.e. no supervision required. A Level 2
contributor have proved commitment, with a noticeable presence on both
international and BR community, producing relevant contents, attending relevant
events and meetings.

##### Expected Roles

- Level 1 expected roles;
- Noticeable presence on events, coordinating at least one aspect (speech,
  interaction dynamics...);
- Complex content production like long videos, podcasts, interviews, articles,
  tutorials;
- Support and help the community to handle some possible issues, as well as
  report the feedbacks using the correct mean of communication with Decred devs
  (github issues and discussions, appropriate matrix channel...);
- Review and evaluate social media metrics, analyse the performance of our
  marketing campaigns, and provide a report document periodically.
- Supervise Level 1 contributors

#### Level 3

Rate: $30/hr

The last and top level of Decred Brazil contribution journey. A contributor from
this level is experienced enough to coordinate the team along with other Level 3
contributors. It is responsible for planning marketing campaigns, strategies,
and enhance public relations.

##### Expected Roles

- Level 2 roles;
- Decide the marketing approach and coordinate marketing campaigns;
- Choose which crypto events and meetings the team will participate;
- Be in touch with influencers and big players on the BR crypto scenario;
- Promote public relations with mainstream media vehicles;
- Administrate and coordinate both virtual and real-life communities.

#### Supervisor

Rate: $80/week

Responsible for reviewing invoices, controlling the budget, and providing
updates about the work done for each month using the Proposal Update section
on Politeia.

The main role of the supervisor is to provide transparency for the budget spent
on the proposal.

A rate of $80/week is enough to cover the time spent on the described
roles.

A supervisor is not an active contributor of the social media, but it helps
other contributors on content creation and other roles described above.

## Budget

A rate of **$17/hr** will be used as an average for this budget estimate, with
an estimated workload of **15h/week** for each contributor, which results in a
rounded amount of **$18,500.00** budget for labor.

We are also adding a monthly amount of $200 for marketing campaigns and ad boosts.

| Type            | Amount ($USD) |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Labor           | 18,900.00     |
| Ads             | 1,200.00      |
| Events Expenses | 1,500.00      |
| Misc.           | 400.00        |
| **TOTAL**       | 22,000.00     |

## Milestones

The team will focus on delivering an average of at least:

- 1 post/day on Instagram, with our own design and description text;
- 3 Instagram stories/day;
- 3 tweets/day;
- 3 Facebook posts/week;
- 3 TikTok videos/week
- 1 event or meetup attendence per month;
- 2 participations on external channels, podcasts, interviews per month;

This will result in a total of:

| Content Type                | Amount |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| **Instagram** Stories       | 540    |
| **Instagram** Posts         | 180    |
