# Decred Brazil - Communication and Content Production

# What

This proposal seeks funding for the reactivation and production of content for Decred Brazil social Media accounts such as Twitter, Instagram and creation of a brand new TikTok account.

# Why

We seek to continue and improve the production of Social Media content for Brazilian audience. In that way we can engage the community and spread our word to possible new investors and contributors.

Brazilians are very addicted to internet and social media. They spend an average of 3 hours and 42 minutes per day on Social Media, according to Sortlist (marketing enterprise). In that way we can understand that actions in this segment represent an opportunity for Decred awareness growth.

# Who

jpsantanna has been managing Decred Brazil social media accounts since November 2021

> TODO: add more techical reviewers (Br devs, community members...)
victorguedes has been reviewing the technical parts of the posts and also contributing with ideas for content

> We will follow the current Contractor model where all eligible contributors can bill against this proposal.

# Role

Our posts, which include Tweets (single posts and threads), Images, videos and memes focusing on explaining Decred fundamentals and also bringing the community together. Ideas include:

- Decred’s History

- Developing of the project

- Tools and concepts

- Decred Differentials

- What is Politeia, DCRDEX, DAO 

- Project updates (new versions, proposals)

- Interaction posts (questions, quizzes)

- Quotes about the project

- Video ads

- Weekly Twitter Spaces with a different theme every 15 days

- Translation of content to portuguese (decred journal, decred in depth)

- Memes

We are also creating a community Discord and Matrix channel, so the Brazilian community can communicate easier and increase its interaction.

# Budget

This proposal is planned to run for the next 6 months with the budget of **$5600** with the current contributors setup.

This quantity will cover:

- $4800 labor

  - $800/month for content production

- $600 for ad boosts 

- Every post unrelated to crypto financial services in Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook can be promoted with money so more people can be reached with the content. The plan here is to focus on promoting the project’s fundamentals (decentralization, security, scarcity, privacy and self-empowerment...) instead of focusing on the (promotion of) financial income/outcome.
